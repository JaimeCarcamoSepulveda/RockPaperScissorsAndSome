FUNCTIONS TO CREATE: 

getComputerChoice 
=this function will randomly choose RP | S and return it. 
	use console.log() to verify it is working properly

=write function that plays single round of RPS. 
 =will take two parameters 
		1.-playerSelection — must be case insensitive.
		2.-computerSelection
then returns string that declares the winner of the round

WIN -“you wiiiinnnnn!”
YOU LOSE
	“You lose! Rock beats scissors”

	“You lose! Scissors bets paper”

NOTE: Use return for final code and console.log for testing and debugging it. 

game()

returns winner and looser at the end. 

NOTE: 
console.log() will be used to display the results of each play and final winner.
